## Inspiration
Flixe was inspired by the need to provide a unified platform for filmmakers to create, manage, and monetize their projects seamlessly. Recognizing the fragmentation in the industry, I aimed to integrate essential tools and support mechanisms to empower creators.

## What it does
Flixe is a dynamic digital film ecosystem designed to streamline the filmmaking process. You can create a movie or series with multiple episodes and manage its finance, cast, advertising, community, and monetization needs. Our core feature, Project Management, allows users to:

- **Create Movie Projects**: Add movie details, producers, cast, and crew.
- **Set Budgets and Secure Funding**: Opt for self-funding, loans, or crowdfunding.
- **Recruit Team Members**: Utilize inbuilt social media to find and manage top talent.
- **Flexible Payment Options**: Choose from pre-pay, post-pay, or revenue-sharing contracts.

Flixe goes beyond just creation and management. It empowers filmmakers with robust tools for ad management, premium subscriptions, financial support, direct sales, and auctions. Leveraging the Theta Network and Theta Edge Cloud Video API, Flixe ensures exceptional security, reliability, and superior video streaming quality.

## How I built it
Flixe was built from the ground up using Theta Network and Theta Edge Cloud Video API, designed specifically to leverage their unique capabilities.

- **Theta Edge Cloud Video API**: This API is the backbone of Flixe, managing content storage and streaming. It ensures high-quality, low-latency video delivery, crucial for a seamless viewing experience.
- **Theta Blockchain Technology**: All blockchain transactions and smart contracts are deployed on the Theta Network, providing top-notch security and transparency. This includes automated processes for crowdfunding, loan agreements, and revenue sharing, making financial transactions efficient and error-free.
- **Smart Contracts**: Utilized to automate and secure financial transactions, ensuring creators and investors have a transparent and reliable process for funding and revenue sharing.

To ensure Flixe is user-friendly, I invested significant time in the design phase, focusing on creating an intuitive UI/UX. This attention to detail ensures that filmmakers can easily navigate and manage their projects efficiently. Flixe’s robust infrastructure and user-centric design make it an unparalleled platform for filmmakers, built entirely on Theta Network and Theta Edge Cloud Video API to provide the best possible experience for content creation, management, and monetization.

## Challenges I ran into
Building Flixe was challenging due to my limited knowledge in web development and blockchain. Despite having a clear vision, I had to learn both skills on the fly, leading to many sleepless nights. Integrating Theta Network and Theta Edge Cloud Video API required extensive problem-solving. Ensuring a user-friendly interface for complex processes like project management and funding took multiple design iterations. The tight hackathon timeline added pressure, but my dedication to Flixe’s vision drove me to overcome these obstacles and create a robust platform.

## Accomplishments that I’m proud of
I’m proud of how Flixe has come together as a fully functional platform within the tight hackathon timeline. I developed my own authentication system for Next.js with Theta, ensuring secure user access. I also built a robust advertisement and billboard management system, and a complete loan and crowdfunding system, all from scratch. Integrating these features into the frontend to function properly was a significant achievement. These accomplishments highlight the potential of Flixe as a secure, reliable, and user-friendly digital film ecosystem.

## What I learned
In building Flixe, I delved deep into the Theta Network and Theta Edge Cloud Video API, mastering seamless integration and efficient content streaming. I learned to create and deploy smart contracts on the Theta blockchain, ensuring secure and transparent transactions. This journey also taught me how to develop a production-grade application, balancing complex functionalities with user-friendly design.
